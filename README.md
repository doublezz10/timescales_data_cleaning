# Timescales Data Cleaning

This repo contains .py and .m files for cleaning, reorganizing, and otherwise
preparing data for use in our timescales project.

The ultimate goal here is to have .mat files for each dataset, containing
structures with relevant species/unit ID data as well as arrays of spike times
both from fixation or rest periods and from the entire task.
